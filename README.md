# VimDocHu
Ongoing Translation of the Vim reference &amp; help files

## How to configure
* Please move the 'hu' directory into your $VIMRUNTIME/doc
* remove tags (and) tags-hu files from $VIMRUNTIME/doc
* run ':helptags $VIMRUNTIME/doc' in vim
* Add to your .vimrc to prioritize hu help files ':helplang=hu,en'

## If something is not clear
* mark that with an '???' and leave the whole sentence and/or section untranslated and we will figure that out later
